# Introduction:

In this data analysis project, we will be exploring the factors that contribute to the financial success of a movie, 
with a focus on the role of inflation. The film industry is a highly competitive and rapidly changing field, and understanding 
the factors that drive box office success is crucial for anyone looking to produce, distribute, or invest in movies.

We will be using the CMU movies corpus, a dataset of movie release and financial data, to identify patterns and trends 
that can help us understand what makes a movie financially successful. Specifically, we will be examining the relationship between a movie's budget, 
box office earnings, and inflation rate, and using statistical techniques to model and predict the success of future movies.

We will begin by introducing the CMU movies corpus and describing the data cleaning and preparation process. Next, we will explore the data through 
visualizations and statistical tests, looking for relationships and patterns that may help us understand the factors that contribute to financial success. 
Finally, we will use machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can help us make informed decisions about which movies are likely 
to be financially successful.

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive and data-driven approach to understanding the financial success of movies, taking into account 
the impact of inflation and other key factors. By following this statistical guideline, we hope to help producers, distributors, and investors make 
informed decisions about which movies are likely to be financially successful in the future.
