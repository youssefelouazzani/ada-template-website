# Introduction:

Everyone loves movies! They provide entertainment and escape from the stresses of daily life, and it's no surprise that the movie industry plays a significant role in the global entertainment market. In fact, the global box office was worth $42.2 billion in 2019, showing the huge demand for movies and the potential for financial success.

But what makes a movie financially successful? Is it the duration of the movie, the presence of certain actors and their notoriety, the genre it belongs to, or the budget dedicated to the movie? In this data story, we aim to use a data-driven approach to uncover the factors that contribute to a movie's financial profitability. To do this, we will analyze a subset of movies that were released in the US between 1980 and 2010, using the CMU Movies dataset and enriching it with data from Wikidata, TMDb, and IMDb. By measuring the success of a movie using the Profit feature, defined as the difference between the revenue and the budget, we will reveal the key factors that can drive the financial success of a movie.
